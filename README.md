# Oil-Spill-Shape-Factor-Model
In this repository you can find a numerical model developed for the slick spreading with shape factor under instantaneous and continuous re-leases through ODE Interface of the COMSOL Multiphysics.  
1. Slick spreading with shape factor under instantaneous release
2. Slick spreading with shape factor under continious release
